## Usage

You'll have 2 grid views. The left one is for the male and the right one is for the female character. If you would like to create an outfit for your male character then simply select all the items you would like to have on your male character by clicking on the "List" button and selecting them.
Once you are done you will then see all items you would have to select on the other gender (e.g. female) to get the items for your male character.
